Players / Team Data Tracker

Player Data Tracker is an application that allows you to enter
player information into a database, and quickly search and sort
through the players, adding the ones you like into a favorites list
while also being able to view all of the statistics of that player.

Technologies Used:

- Javascript
- CSS
- LiquidJS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

As a user I will be able to:
- Sign Up
- Log In
- Log Out
- Create a player
- Edit a player
- Set a players stats
- View a list of players
- View a list of favorited players
- Sort player by a statistic (A-Z, Points High->Low, Points Low->High)
- Remove a player from favorites

Schedule:

Since I have 10 To-Do's I'll try to tackle 2 of them each day depending on what feels like makes the most sense.

Things I would like to add onto this project after finishing the above:

- Match Searching / Queue System
- Win entries
- Loss entries
- ELO algorithm to give skill estimation of participating players
