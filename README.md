Players / Team Data Tracker

Player Data Tracker is an application that allows you to enter
player information into a database, and quickly search and sort
through the players, adding the ones you like into a favorites list
while also being able to view all of the statistics of that player.

Technologies Used:

Javascript
CSS
LiquidJS
MongoDB
Mongoose

As a user I will be able to:
-- Sign Up
-- Log In
-- Log Out
-- Create a player
-- Edit a player
-- Set a players stats
-- View a list of players
-- View a list of favorited players
-- Sort player by a statistic (A-Z, Points High->Low, Points Low->High)
-- Remove a player from favorites

Things I would like to add onto this project after finishing the above:

-- Match Searching / Queue System
-- Win entries
-- Loss entries
-- ELO algorithm to give skill estimation of participating players
